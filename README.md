# face-space
Demonstrates the systematic mapping of cat vs. dog vs. wild animal faces to a 2D input space to the Encoder of a variational autoencoder (VAE).

## Setup

Using a python virtual environment is prefered. To do so, in a terminal run the following: `python3 -m venv env`

Activate the virtual environment by next running the command: `. env/bin/activate`

Then, install the dependencies: `pip -r requirements.txt`

This demonstration relies and the Animal Faces dataset that can be downloaded from: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/animal-faces?resource=download](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/animal-faces?resource=download). Once this is downloaded, extract it into the current directory.

Open Juypter Notebook and run the face-space notebook: `jupyter notebook`.
